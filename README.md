## About Me
Mathematical Engineering student at the University of Chile, currently in the tenth semester and pursuing a minor in Data Science. I possess a solid foundation in both pure and applied mathematics, complemented by a comprehensive education in engineering. Currently, my primary interest lies in machine learning and deep learning, approached from both theoretical and applied perspectives.
I have experience working on both academic and professional projects, ranging from **optimal control theory** and **PDE-based inpainting** to **data extraction** and **process automation** in the export industry.
  
## Skills
- **Mathematics & Optimization**: Convex analysis, machine learning, stochastic simulation, and differential equations.
- **Programming**: Python, Julia, SQL, and experience with frameworks such as PyTorch and OpenCV.
- **Data Science**: Machine learning, data mining, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **Tools**: Git, and MacOS app development.

## Some of My Favorite Projects
- [**Inpainting using PDEs**](https://github.com/Sebastijo/Inpainting-de-Imagenes-usando-Ecuaciones-en-Derivadas-Parciales): Mathematical models and algorithms to restore missing parts of an image.
- **MRI Simulation**: Simulating electron control on a 2D Bloch sphere.
- **Data Science Tools**: Automating data extraction and manipulation for business use cases.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced **Machine Learning** techniques.
- Refining skills in **Julia** for high-performance computing in mathematical applications.
- Convex Analysis.


## Goals for 2024
- Integrate **deep learning** methods into **optimal control problems** (or the other way around).
- Collaborate on machine learning projects

## How I Work
I love using open-source software and tools. I’m a fan of Python’s versatility and Julia’s performance for numerical tasks. I also enjoy collaborating with others and contributing to open-source communities.
